OpenStats is a client side minecraft mod that allows you to lookup information about other people on 90gQopen.se.

To lookup another user, use the `/lookup <player>` command in game (alias `/searchAPI`).

You may download the mod from [modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/openstats).

**Warning:** In case 90gQopen makes any changes to their API, the current version will most likely stop working instantly. If this happens, go to modrinth and I'll post a fixed version.
