OpenUtils is a fabric mod that adds multiple QoF features to the minecraft server 90gQopen! It also lets you look up information about other players.

If you want to get notified when a new version of the mod arrives, feel free to join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/F9mkMxPf9g) and select the `@OpenUtils` role!

You can download the mod from [modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/openutils).

## Lookup Command
The `/lookup` command is the main command of this mod, and it opens the full information screen.

**Warning:** In case 90gQopen makes any changes to their public API, I will have to make a new fix-version for it, and you will have to install the newest update.
